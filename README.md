GetDeviceInfo
=============

Small sample app that show how to collect information like "electronic serial number" device name on MSI Android devices

You can find more information about this app on this post over at my blog:

[Getting Device Info From MSI Android Devices](http://pietromaggi.com/blog/getting-device-info-from-msi-android-devices/).

Over time I've added some features to check which is the SDCard path on Motorola Solutions (Now Zebra Technologies) devices. This is documented in this other post:

[Finding the SDCard Path on Android Devices](http://pietromaggi.com/blog/finding-the-sdcard-path-on-android-devices/)

**Disclaimer**

I work for Zebra Technologies, however this sample application is provided as-is, on a personal base, with no support. I hope that's usefull.

Would love to get some feedback @pfmaggi
